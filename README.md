# etch-a-sketch
This project comes from the Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

In this project, I am building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The purpose of this project is to famaliarize 
myself with the basics of web development.
